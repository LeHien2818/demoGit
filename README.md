This is a game which is made by using C++ and library SDL 2.0
This game is all about a bird have to fly in order to avoid a lot of pipes on its way. This is a clone of Flappy Bird origin, but i did redesign the bird,
pipes and the background as well. I also added some sound effects by using SDL_mixer library.
How to play:
  - you can click your mouse or press SPACE key on the keyboard to start the Game, and also use it to help
  your Bird can jump a short distance verlically so as to not collide the barriers(the pipes). Each pipe that you pass will help your score
increase by 1. Try you best to score the highest mark in the Game.

Knowledge that i did use in this project:
- install and set up the SDL2.0 library to assist me with making games.
- using SDL mixer and SDL image to make game become more vivid. 
- Basic OOP which helps me understand and building the game structurally such as: struct, class, ...
- Knowlege relating to dynamic memory such as pointer, list,..
